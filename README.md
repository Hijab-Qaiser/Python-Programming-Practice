# Python-Programming-Practice
A comprehensive collection of Python programming exercises completed during A Level Computer Science (9618) preparation. Each file represents an individual problem, solved with clarity and examination-focused logic.


## Overview

This repository contains a carefully structured collection of **Python programming exercises**, completed as part of preparation for **Cambridge International A Level Computer Science (9618)**.

Each exercise has been implemented as an **independent Python file**, ensuring clarity, modularity, and strong alignment with examination expectations. The solutions emphasise **logical correctness**, **explicit variable handling**, and **foundational programming principles**, rather than reliance on advanced built-in shortcuts.

In total, this repository reflects the completion of **approximately 100 progressively challenging questions**, spanning beginner to advanced problem-solving techniques.

## Repository Structure

- **Each file represents one complete question**
- File numbering corresponds to question order
- No inter-file dependency — every solution is standalone
- Code is written with examination-friendly clarity

This approach mirrors how problems are presented and assessed in **Paper 4 (Programming)**.
